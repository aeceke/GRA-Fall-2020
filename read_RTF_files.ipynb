      "\n",
      "On Dec. 13, the proposed Rosemont Copper project in southwestern Arizona -- which would produce about one-tenth of all the copper in the U.S. every year -- got the green light from the U.S. Forest Service to begin operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long time coming -- more than seven years after the company presented its mine plan and began the National Environmental Protection Act review process. Then again, since the average time to get a mine permitted in the U.S. is a worst-in-the-world seven-to-10 years, Rosemont's long wait isn't the exception. It's the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Forest Service's approval should be great news for our high-tech economy, powered by copper in, for instance, electric vehicles, smart homes and smartphones (about 10% of an average phone's weight is copper). But that decision is overshadowed by the last remaining -- and most formidable -- governmental hurdle, the Environmental Protection Agency, the guardian of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Having run the gauntlet of state and local permitting requirements, Rosemont now faces two potentially fatal challenges from the EPA in the final stages of review: either death by a thousand pesky comments or an outright veto.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bureaucratic equivalent of sticky riot foam -- a substance meant to slow and stop people on the street -- every few months, a couple of dozen pages furl out from the EPA to Rosemont's managers. Past communications have included the suggestion that the project might jeopardize the leopard frog, or the Gila topminnow, or the water umbrel. One official worry was that the project might impede the opportunity for people to canoe in a desert region where summer temperatures reach 118 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA churns out concerns about potential impacts on 18 miles of streams and threats to the \"water quality\" of the Davidson Canyon Wash, a single gulch -- filled intermittently by rain -- in a state with 39,039 rivers and streams. The agency also lets Rosemont know it will be looking at the impacts of mining on air quality -- but only after a preliminary process to determine which air-quality standard should apply. Each governmental query receives a Rosemont reply in the never-ending race toward a moving finish line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even this snail's pace doesn't satisfy antimining advocates. Many environmentalists and anticapitalists (and many critics are both) would like to see the EPA simply short-circuit the review process and veto the mine proposal. After all, the agency has used Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to shut down a mine -- famously, the Spruce Mine in West Virginia -- even after it had received its operating permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most vocal environmental groups, the EPA is perfectly suited as judge and jury. Jennifer Krill, the director of Earthworks, confirmed in congressional testimony earlier this year that her group has never supported or endorsed a single U.S. mine. The threat of an EPA Clean Water Act veto of various projects hangs over more than $220 billion in economic development, ranging from mines to agriculture and infrastructure projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly for communities around the proposed mine -- about 30 miles southwest of Tucson in an area where unemployment is still stubbornly close to 10% -- every day of delay means a longer wait for much-needed jobs, which would funnel much-needed revenue into local tax coffers. Mothers and fathers struggling to support their families may feel endangered, but unlike the leopard frog, they're not on a government list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nation, meanwhile, is losing the output of a mine with a projected yearly output of more than 100,000 metric tons. That's Arizona copper the U.S. wouldn't need to import from abroad, feeding a negative balance of trade, and providing political and economic leverage to nations that supply the metal we fail to mine ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we mine fewer metals, won't manufacturing jobs leave the U.S. and go where the metals are? If we don't mine in the U.S. -- with arguably the world's most stringent oversight, environmental and safety standards -- won't Americans end up importing products made with metals mined in other places under less-stringent standards (if any), leading to far more damage to the environment and the health of the miners? All of these questions are critical to determining whether a mine serves the public good. Surely they must matter to the nation as much as a topminnow does to the EPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, did Congress pass the National Environmental Protection Act to put in place a means of balancing the benefits of resource extraction with competing public goods? Or did it set up an endless bureaucratic gauntlet designed to delay, derail or economically exhaust mine developers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven and a half years on, Rosemont Copper is still waiting for an answer.\n",

      "Waste Management Inc., the country's largest collector and processor of waste, is looking to trim its portfolio of investments in risky startup companies, as it still waits to see a payoff from substantial investments in new biofuel and other technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 to 18 months, the company has exited some of its 25 or so investments made over the past several years, according to Bill Caesar, president of WM Organic Growth, a unit of Waste Management tasked with finding technologies to back outside the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see some evolution in our investing. All things being equal I would rather invest in an operating entity than in a very early stage technology. I'd rather not have all that risk,\" Mr. Caesar said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Houston-based company, which has a $21 billion market capitalization, built up the portfolio of new waste-processing technology companies by investing alongside venture capital firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Braemar Energy Ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was an unusual move in the waste industry. The company's closest competitor, Republic Services Inc., doesn't appear to have made any meaningful investments in startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste Management hoped when making the investments that the companies would help convert more of the waste it collected into useful chemicals and fuels. Typically a large percentage of the waste the company collects is landfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste Management continues to set environmental improvement goals. For example, it plans to triple the eight million tons of recyclables it processes by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is still waiting for a payoff on its venture investments. Three companies backed by Waste Management -- Enerkem Inc., Genomatica Inc. and Fulcrum Bioenergy Inc. -- tried to go public but pulled their IPOs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several biofuels and biochemicals startups over the past few years ran into technical difficulties ramping up their production facilities. At the same time the general markets changed. The lower price of natural gas, for example, made conversion of waste into electricity a more difficult proposition economically, because the process competed with cheaper alternatives, according to Mr. Caesar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is now looking to invest in commercial-stage rather than venture-stage technologies, although there aren't many options out there, according to Mr. Caesar, who is also president of WM Recycle America, another Waste Management subsidiary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2012, Waste Management's chief executive, David Steiner, said the company had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the portfolio. The company often put money into startups directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The initial thinking was that you wouldn't get to something that was commercial scale if you didn't invest in the parent,\" Mr. Caesar said.\n",

      "This past year will be remembered for many things, but let 2013 be hailed mainly for this: It was the year that the genius of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" became clear in America. Efforts to centralize control in the name of \"fairness\" have led to a society that is ever more at the mercy of a federal power -- one that decides who does and does not succeed. The winners are favored special interests, political cronies and wealthy lobbyists. The losers are everyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider: Maryland authorities last week launched an investigation into the shootings of two bald eagles in Montgomery County. It isn't clear if the federally protected birds were shot on purpose, or if some poor soul mistook them for vultures. No matter. The Maryland Natural Resources Police (there is such a thing) has gone full vice squad -- publicizing a hotline number, dangling a reward, and reminding folks that the federal penalty is a fine of $5,000 per eagle and up to a year in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "This behavior contrasts with a very different headline, from a month ago. \"U.S. to Allow Eagle Deaths -- to Aid Wind Power,\" read a Dec. 6 Associated Press story about a new federal rule that allows wind companies favored by the Obama administration to avoid the law. These select companies can kill bald and golden eagles, free of prosecution, for 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within minutes of 2013's beginning, Congress had passed its huge new tax-cliff increase, which President Obama crowed would ensure that \"millionaires and billionaires\" will \"pay their fair share.\" Yet included in that bill was $40 billion in exemptions for the politically powerful -- Michigan Nascar-track owners, rum distillers, renewable energy firms, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "ObamaCare was passed in the name of equalizing health care. Yet it was Congress and its staffers who got special dispensation to keep a generous health subsidy -- when no other Americans did. It was powerful corporate America, with its influential lobbyists, that got an additional year to meet the insurance mandate -- when individuals did not. It was the unions that got a reprieve from a health-insurance tax -- when individuals and small businesses were left to pick up the tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a new ethanol mandate, though it exempted one lucky refinery in Louisiana, out of 143 nationwide. That refinery happens to be under the patronage of Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, up for re-election this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congressional Democrats advanced measures in 2013 to pile new taxes on fossil fuel companies. This, as the Energy Department continued to absorb the losses of Solyndra, A123 Systems, and other taxpayer-funded green-energy firms, some of which are owned by political donors to Mr. Obama.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Justice Department in November settled with J.P. Morgan for $13 billion, for the sin of dealing in \"toxic\" mortgage-backed securities. Some of that payout will go to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sources of the housing collapse that are nonetheless wards of the state -- and thus, apparently, safe from Justice lawsuits. Citibank, so immersed in subprime as to require a bailout, also escaped Obama prosecutors. But Citibank is the producer of -- and landing spot for -- key Obama appointees, including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April, the IRS was outed for targeting conservative political groups. The Obama administration in December issued new rules that will institutionalize this silencing of conservative free speech under the guise of regulating 501(c)(4) organizations. Unions, which file under a different IRS nonprofit category, will continue unmolested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA this summer conducted an armed raid of a mining facility in Alaska, over putative violations of the Clean Water Act. The Federal Trade Commission harassed a nonprofit representing piano teachers, over ginned up antitrust violations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration began cracking down on small, family farms, operations meant to be exempt from that agency's regulation. By contrast, the administration has yet to announce a single prosecution of a single individual at the IRS. Mr. Obama explained in December that IRS employees were simply victims of a \"difficult law to interpret.\" Maybe like the Clean Water Act, or antitrust laws, or OSHA rules? Maybe not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's plenty more, but you get the picture. In \"Animal Farm\" George Orwell set out to show how power inevitably corrupts, no matter how noble the intention. A group of animals initially centralize control over the farm to ensure that \"All animals are equal.\" Yet the novel ends with the barnyard commandants -- high on their righteousness -- reducing the commandments to just one: \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, in ObamaWorld, many millionaires, health-care buyers, energy companies, subprime dealers, political groups, and bird killers are more equal than others. Our new elite is ever more defined by who has the best pull with the administration. So long as government grows, so too will this government-created inequality.\n",

      "On Dec. 13, the proposed Rosemont Copper project in southwestern Arizona—which would produce about one-tenth of all the copper in the U.S. every year—got the green light from the U.S. Forest Service to begin operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long time coming—more than seven years after the company presented its mine plan and began the National Environmental Policy Act review process. Then again, since the average time to get a mine permitted in the U.S. is a worst-in-the-world seven-to-10 years, Rosemont's long wait isn't the exception. It's the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Forest Service's approval should be great news for our high-tech economy, powered by copper in, for instance, electric vehicles, smart homes and smartphones (about 10% of an average phone's weight is copper). But that decision is overshadowed by the last remaining—and most formidable—governmental hurdle, the Environmental Protection Agency, the guardian of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Having run the gauntlet of state and local permitting requirements, Rosemont now faces two potentially fatal challenges from the EPA in the final stages of review: either death by a thousand pesky comments or an outright veto.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bureaucratic equivalent of sticky riot foam—a substance meant to slow and stop people on the street—every few months, a couple of dozen pages furl out from the EPA to Rosemont's managers. Past communications have included the suggestion that the project might jeopardize the leopard frog, or the Gila topminnow, or the water umbrel. One official worry was that the project might impede the opportunity for people to canoe in a desert region where summer temperatures reach 118 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA churns out concerns about potential impacts on 18 miles of streams and threats to the \"water quality\" of the Davidson Canyon Wash, a single gulch—filled intermittently by rain—in a state with 39,039 rivers and streams. The agency also lets Rosemont know it will be looking at the impacts of mining on air quality—but only after a preliminary process to determine which air-quality standard should apply. Each governmental query receives a Rosemont reply in the never-ending race toward a moving finish line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even this snail's pace doesn't satisfy antimining advocates. Many environmentalists and anticapitalists (and many critics are both) would like to see the EPA simply short-circuit the review process and veto the mine proposal. After all, the agency has used Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to shut down a mine—famously, the Spruce Mine in West Virginia—even after it had received its operating permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most vocal environmental groups, the EPA is perfectly suited as judge and jury. Jennifer Krill, the director of Earthworks, confirmed in congressional testimony earlier this year that her group has never supported or endorsed a single U.S. mine. The threat of an EPA Clean Water Act veto of various projects hangs over more than $220 billion in economic development, ranging from mines to agriculture and infrastructure projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly for communities around the proposed mine—about 30 miles southwest of Tucson in an area where unemployment is still stubbornly close to 10%—every day of delay means a longer wait for much-needed jobs, which would funnel much-needed revenue into local tax coffers. Mothers and fathers struggling to support their families may feel endangered, but unlike the leopard frog, they're not on a government list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nation, meanwhile, is losing the output of a mine with a projected yearly output of more than 100,000 metric tons. That's Arizona copper the U.S. wouldn't need to import from abroad, feeding a negative balance of trade, and providing political and economic leverage to nations that supply the metal we fail to mine ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we mine fewer metals, won't manufacturing jobs leave the U.S. and go where the metals are? If we don't mine in the U.S.—with arguably the world's most stringent oversight, environmental and safety standards—won't Americans end up importing products made with metals mined in other places under less-stringent standards (if any), leading to far more damage to the environment and the health of the miners? All of these questions are critical to determining whether a mine serves the public good. Surely they must matter to the nation as much as a topminnow does to the EPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, did Congress pass the National Environmental Policy Act to put in place a means of balancing the benefits of resource extraction with competing public goods? Or did it set up an endless bureaucratic gauntlet designed to delay, derail or economically exhaust mine developers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven and a half years on, Rosemont Copper is still waiting for an answer.\n",

      "   By Yuliya Chernova \n",
      "\n",
      "Waste Management Inc., the country's largest collector and processor of waste, is looking to trim its portfolio of investments in risky startup companies, as it still waits to see a payoff from substantial investments in new biofuel and other technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 to 18 months, the company has exited some of its 25 or so investments made over the past several years, according to Bill Caesar, president of WM Organic Growth, a unit of Waste Management tasked with finding technologies to back outside the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see some evolution in our investing. All things being equal I would rather invest in an operating entity than in a very early stage technology. I'd rather not have all that risk,\" Mr. Caesar said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Houston-based company, which has a $21 billion market capitalization, built up the portfolio of new waste-processing technology companies by investing alongside venture capital firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Braemar Energy Ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was an unusual move in the waste industry. The company's closest competitor, Republic Services Inc., doesn't appear to have made any meaningful investments in startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste Management hoped when making the investments that the companies would help convert more of the waste it collected into useful chemicals and fuels. Typically a large percentage of the waste the company collects is landfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste Management continues to set environmental improvement goals. For example, it plans to triple the eight million tons of recyclables it processes by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is still waiting for a payoff on its venture investments. Three companies backed by Waste Management -- Enerkem Inc., Genomatica Inc. and Fulcrum Bioenergy Inc. -- tried to go public but pulled their IPOs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several biofuels and biochemicals startups over the past few years ran into technical difficulties ramping up their production facilities. At the same time the general markets changed. The lower price of natural gas, for example, made conversion of waste into electricity a more difficult proposition economically, because the process competed with cheaper alternatives, according to Mr. Caesar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is now looking to invest in commercial-stage rather than venture-stage technologies, although there aren't many options out there, according to Mr. Caesar, who is also president of WM Recycle America, another Waste Management subsidiary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2012, Waste Management's chief executive, David Steiner, said the company had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the portfolio. The company often put money into startups directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The initial thinking was that you wouldn't get to something that was commercial scale if you didn't invest in the parent,\" Mr. Caesar said.\n",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Following the filing of an Application for Reconsideration of the Opinions and Order entered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on December 19, 2013, James D. Schultz, General Counsel to the Governor, released the following statement:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today, lawyers representing Commonwealth agencies and officials in the Robinson Township matter have sought reconsideration of the Supreme Court's December 19, 2013, Opinions and Order. In the Robinson Township decision, the Court declared key provisions of Act 13 of 2012 (the Commonwealth's oil and gas law) to be unconstitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "In announcing a never-before-employed balancing test against which the constitutional validity of the law is to be judged, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made its own sweeping factual findings regarding the impact of Act 13, none of which finds any support in the sparse and uneven factual record that was made before Commonwealth Court. The Supreme Court's decision is a stunning departure from the historical practice of that Court, and an unrestrained venture into a fact-finding role that the Court always has insisted is not its proper place in the judicial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, today's request for reconsideration seeks to give Act 13 its fair day in court, as every law of this Commonwealth deserves when challenged. We are asking the Supreme Court to follow its own established precedent and remand the case to Commonwealth Court for the development of an evidentiary record (through a fair and thorough process in which all parties have a real and equal opportunity to participate), application of the Court's newly-pronounced standards to the facts as found by the Commonwealth Court (with legal briefs from all parties), and finally a fair and final determination as to whether Act 13 violates Article I, Section 27 based on a full record and formal findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Department of Environmental Protection is asking the Supreme Court to reconsider a decision that certain provisions of Act 13 that involve the agency's responsibility to protect public resources (such as public parks) cannot stand separately from provisions that the Court has determined are unconstitutional. The Department contends that the Supreme Court misunderstood how the statutory provisions work separately from each other and asks the Court to direct Commonwealth Court to study that question as part of the other matters it must examine on remand.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- A recent Environmental Protection Agency ruling that sewage sludge gasification technology patented by MaxWest Environmental Systems Inc., is not an incinerator heralds a major victory not only for clean air and water but also for taxpayers in municipalities looking for a sustainable alternative to costly incineration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA, in a letter dated Dec. 19, determined that federal emissions guidelines and compliance rules for sewage sludge incinerators do not apply to a MaxWest sludge gasifier near Sanford, Fla. The ruling came in response to a request from McGuireWoods LLP, which represented the company before the regulatory agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its findings, the EPA held that MaxWest's pioneering technology that breaks down sewage sludge through heating in an oxygen-starved environment prevents combustion, and thus will not be regulated as an incinerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agency further exempted from incinerator regulations the second energy-saving step in the process -- a \"thermal oxidizer process heater\" in which gases released from thermochemical reactions are scrubbed and then burned to create heat needed to dry incoming sludge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result of the process is a self-sufficient closed-loop system that requires little or no fossil fuel after start-up, drastically reducing costs of and emissions from using natural gas for an incinerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This ruling is definitely good news for communities and sewage treatment plant operators. Being free from the regulatory burdens of the sewage sludge incinerator rule will allow MaxWest to deploy the technology more cheaply,\" said Bernadette Rappold, a Washington-based McGuireWoods partner who led the MaxWest legal team, along with senior counsel Cameron Prell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MaxWest process carries other environmental, commercial and economic benefits. Gasification produces a more valuable fertilizer for farmers since some of the carbon that incineration destroys remains in the solid byproduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as space in landfills becomes scarce and motor fuel costs climb, the costs of hauling and disposing of sludge in them have skyrocketed. MaxWest's gasification technology also eliminates air and groundwater pollution risks that landfill disposal of sludge poses.\n",
      "\n",
      "MaxWest is in negotiations to deploy its technology in several municipalities across the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "December's EPA ruling is not the first time the agency has cast a vote of confidence in MaxWest's technology. In a June 2012 report, the EPA extolled the benefits of its gasification process for its emissions control and green energy benefits and singled out MaxWest as the only domestic gasification technology ready for prime time.\n",

      "Research and Markets () has announced the addition of the \"Global Algae Biofuel Technologies Market 2014-2018\" report to their offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governments in various countries including the US, Italy, China, Germany, and India have been funding biofuel projects, and have introduced incentives and subsidies to vendors that produce biofuels. For instance, the US has announced a stimulus package of US$100 billion to develop clean, alternative, and renewable technologies. The US Government has also introduced its Renewable Fuels Reinvestment Act, which proposes an extension of Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, allowing a US$0.54 per gallon tariff on imported ethanol until December 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has also introduced various tax credits to help improve the production of ethanol. The US Department of Energy has awarded US$151 million in funding to 37 biofuel-related projects under its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program. Similar incentives are being introduced in other countries and this is one of the major trends which is expected to drive the Global Algae Biofuel Technologies market in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the increasing environmental awareness. The increase in pollution caused by fossil-based fuels is one of the major reasons for the increase in demand for alternative vehicle fuels. The ability of biofuels produced from algae to reduce environmental pollution significantly is in turn driving the growth of the Global Algae Biofuel Technologies market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this market is the high cost of production of algae biofuels. Second and third-generation biofuel feedstock such as algae and bacteria requires a high initial cost for its production. Apart from production costs, the companies involved in the production of biofuels from algae also incur the high costs of fuel conversion. This can have a negative impact on the growth of the market in the near term.\n",

      "This past year will be remembered for many things, but let 2013 be hailed mainly for this: It was the year that the genius of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" became clear in America. Efforts to centralize control in the name of \"fairness\" have led to a society that is ever more at the mercy of a federal power—one that decides who does and does not succeed. The winners are favored special interests, political cronies and wealthy lobbyists. The losers are everyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider: Maryland authorities last week launched an investigation into the shootings of two bald eagles in Montgomery County. It isn't clear if the federally protected birds were shot on purpose, or if some poor soul mistook them for vultures. No matter. The Maryland Natural Resources Police (there is such a thing) has gone full vice squad—publicizing a hotline number, dangling a reward, and reminding folks that the federal penalty is a fine of $5,000 per eagle and up to a year in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "This behavior contrasts with a very different headline, from a month ago. \"U.S. to Allow Eagle Deaths—to Aid Wind Power,\" read a Dec. 6 Associated Press story about a new federal rule that allows wind companies favored by the Obama administration to avoid the law. These select companies can kill bald and golden eagles, free of prosecution, for 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within minutes of 2013's beginning, Congress had passed its huge new tax-cliff increase, which President Obama crowed would ensure that \"millionaires and billionaires\" will \"pay their fair share.\" Yet included in that bill was $40 billion in exemptions for the politically powerful—Michigan Nascar-track owners, rum distillers, renewable energy firms, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "ObamaCare was passed in the name of equalizing health care. Yet it was Congress and its staffers who got special dispensation to keep a generous health subsidy—when no other Americans did. It was powerful corporate America, with its influential lobbyists, that got an additional year to meet the insurance mandate—when individuals did not. It was the unions that got a reprieve from a health-insurance tax—when individuals and small businesses were left to pick up the tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a new ethanol mandate, though it exempted one lucky refinery in Louisiana, out of 143 nationwide. That refinery happens to be under the patronage of Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, up for re-election this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congressional Democrats advanced measures in 2013 to pile new taxes on fossil fuel companies. This, as the Energy Department continued to absorb the losses of Solyndra, A123 Systems, and other taxpayer-funded green-energy firms, some of which are owned by political donors to Mr. Obama.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Justice Department in November settled with J.P. Morgan for $13 billion, for the sin of dealing in \"toxic\" mortgage-backed securities. Some of that payout will go to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sources of the housing collapse that are nonetheless wards of the state—and thus, apparently, safe from Justice lawsuits. Citibank, so immersed in subprime as to require a bailout, also escaped Obama prosecutors. But Citibank is the producer of—and landing spot for—key Obama appointees, including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\n",

      "In April, the IRS was outed for targeting conservative political groups. The Obama administration in December issued new rules that will institutionalize this silencing of conservative free speech under the guise of regulating 501(c)(4) organizations. Unions, which file under a different IRS nonprofit category, will continue unmolested.\n",

      "The EPA this summer conducted an armed raid of a mining facility in Alaska, over putative violations of the Clean Water Act. The Federal Trade Commission harassed a nonprofit representing piano teachers, over ginned up antitrust violations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration began cracking down on small, family farms, operations meant to be exempt from that agency's regulation. By contrast, the administration has yet to announce a single prosecution of a single individual at the IRS. Mr. Obama explained in December that IRS employees were simply victims of a \"difficult law to interpret.\" Maybe like the Clean Water Act, or antitrust laws, or OSHA rules? Maybe not.\n",

A group of animals initially centralize control over the farm to ensure that \"All animals are equal.\" Yet the novel ends with the barnyard commandants—high on their righteousness—reducing the commandments to just one: \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"\n",

      "Indeed, in ObamaWorld, many millionaires, health-care buyers, energy companies, subprime dealers, political groups, and bird killers are more equal than others. Our new elite is ever more defined by who has the best pull with the administration. So long as government grows, so too will this government-created inequality.\n",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia—Defying government orders to end a weeklong strike, thousands of Cambodian garment workers continued a protest for higher pay Thursday, as union leaders sought fresh talks with labor officials over minimum wages in this key export sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The job action has forced many factories to halt production, stoking concerns about a widening fallout for this Southeast Asian economy. Cambodia relies heavily on garment manufacturing as its main export earner and biggest formal-sector employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labor officials had set a Thursday deadline for workers to end their strike, and warned of legal action against defiant unions. But workers took to the streets, reiterating demands that their minimum wage be doubled to $160 a month—$60 higher than the government's latest offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Union leaders said they would extend the strike unless labor officials and employers agreed to renegotiate workers' salaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the government or employers agree to restart negotiations within three days—today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow—we would negotiate with workers to postpone the protest,\" said Ath Thorn, president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers' Democratic Union. \"But if their response is no, we will continue with the protest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, the Labor Ministry proposed raising the minimum wage by 25% to $100 a month, starting in February—a slight increase over an earlier offer of a 19% raise, to $95 a month, that would start in April. The Asia Floor Wage Alliance, a group of trade unions and labor rights activists, estimates that a living wage for Cambodian garment workers should be $283 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials said they wouldn't better their latest offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There will be no more negotiation, as the ministry has already decided to increase minimum wages to $100 a month,\" Labor Ministry spokesman Heng Sour said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia repeated its warnings about the strike's economic impact. In statements posted Thursday on its website, the association said some of its members have decided to shift the fabrication of certain products from Cambodia to other unnamed countries, while most factories remain shut due to alleged violence and harassment by unionists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The association also said it would neither participate in wage negotiations nor advise its members to restart operations until authorities and unions put an end to the unrest and alleged harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labor officials said they would investigate the harassment claims, though union leaders denied using any illegal or violent means to disrupt factory operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what action the Labor Ministry might take against unions for not ending the strike. Mr. Sour said the ministry has issued notices asking union leaders to review the legality of their activities. Officials warned this week that offending unions could have their licenses suspended or canceled, and union leaders may face lawsuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities, however, stepped up crowd-control efforts Thursday, deploying army paratroopers and riot police to maintain order outside a number of factories in and around the capital Phnom Penh, where thousands of striking workers had gathered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protesting crowds, returning after a break on New Year's Day, appeared slightly thinner than earlier this week. Scores of cash-strapped laborers returned to their jobs, citing a financial need to break the strike, according to local media reports. Even so, minor skirmishes broke out between some protesters and riot police, who arrested about 10 protesters, workers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Garment manufacturing is Cambodia's biggest export business, supplying apparel to retailers mainly in the U.S. and European Union. The industry earned nearly $5.1 billion in the first 11 months of 2013, up 22% from the same period in 2012, according to the Commerce Ministry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cambodia has about 800 garment and footwear factories that employ about 600,000 workers, mostly women, labor officials say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturers favor the country for its low-wage costs, but strikes are frequent because of what union leaders say is widespread discontent with meager salaries, poor working conditions and lax enforcement of labor laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Garment workers mounted 131 strikes from January to November, up from 121 for all of 2012, according to the garment manufacturers' association, making 2013 the most strike-prone year since record-keeping started in 2003.\n",

      "\n",
      "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2014-- \n",
      "\n",
      "Whole Foods Market announced today that its Local Producer Loan Program has reached the initial goal of funding $10 million in low-interest loans to local and independent food businesses, and has now committed up to $25 million in funding. The Local Producer Loan Program (LPLP) has provided 184 loans to 155 companies since its inception in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "In providing easier access to loans for budding food businesses, the program's first $10 million in funding has not only enabled growth, but also supported pioneering projects in biodynamic farming, non-GMO animal feed, pollinator health and sustainable packaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Expanding the Local Producer Loan Program is a direct result of the innovations and successes of our loan recipients,\" said Betsy Foster, Whole Foods Market global vice president of growth and business development. \"By playing a role in advancing new ideas, growing businesses and realizing dreams, Whole Foods Market stays connected with both our neighborhood producers and our global food community.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the additional commitment of $15 million in funding, the company welcomes new loan applications from producers seeking to expand their businesses. Whether applicants offer a distinctive artisan food product or a new hydroponic farming facility, Whole Foods Market loan administrators, buyers and local foragers work closely with business owners to drive growth and success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The most rewarding part of the loan process is building relationships and sharing ideas for progress,\" said Dwight Richmond, Whole Foods Market global grocery purchasing coordinator. \"Whether it's improving the business plan, discussing market trends or connecting people with new partners in our network, it's exciting to see the results of great teamwork combined with monetary support.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The most recent loan, pushing LPLP to the $10 million milestone, was awarded to WholeSoy & Co., an independent, San Francisco-based producer of non-GMO, organic, vegan, gluten-free soy yogurt. The company received $400,000 - one of the program's highest loans to date -- to help build their own (dairy-free) yogurt facility after their co-packer unexpectedly closed for business in mid-2013, leaving them without a way to package their yogurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The loan from Whole Foods Market, one of our original and long term retail supporters, gave us access to the resources we needed at a crucial time. After raising most of the funds required, this additional $400,000 will help us realize our dream of having our own dairy-free yogurt facility,\" said Ted Nordquist, CEO of WholeSoy & Co. \"Whole Foods Market truly cares about our success and worked closely with us to support our re-entry into the marketplace. Their commitment to the brand has been critical in our being able to get WholeSoy back on the shelf for our many loyal consumers in 2014.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While some loan recipients sell products in Whole Foods Market stores, such as organic vegetable farmers, grass-fed cattle ranchers, natural body care producers and gluten-free bakers, many other recipients operate businesses that support the natural foods industry. Additionally, 43 companies are owned by women and an additional 36 are co-owned by women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loan recipients must meet Whole Foods Market's quality standards, use the funds for expansion and have a viable business plan. Typical loans range from $1,000 to $100,000 and have fixed low-interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous loan recipients have used their loans for purchasing more livestock, investing in new equipment, expanding production facilities, adapting to more sustainable practices or converting to organic production.\n",
